# Project Name
Project 4 for MSCH-C220

A basic 2D platformer.

## Implementation

Built with Godot 4.1

Sprite sheet for player provided by project module.

Enemy sprite sheets from Legacy Fantasy game assets by Anokolisa: https://anokolisa.itch.io/sidescroller-pixelart-sprites-asset-pack-forest-16x16

Included 2 main levels and a bonus level. Created my own assets for the backgrounds and tilemaps. Created sound assets for the enemy attacks. 

## What Makes this a Game?

This is a game because the player has the agency to control a character who is traversing a land with dangerous creatures that can kill the player's character and/or be killed by the player's character, dependent on the player's precise actions. The player has an oportunity to get to know the game and get better at it through play and knowledge of the terrain and enemies as well as feel of the player-character movement.
